        <h1>Software development</h1>
        <p class="main-content">
            Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing,
            and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.
            Software development involves writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes
            all processes from the conception of the desired software through the final manifestation, typically in a
            planned and structured process often overlapping with software engineering. Software development also
            includes research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any
            other activities that result in software products.
